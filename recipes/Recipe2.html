    These chocolate-covered strawberries are made with the simplest recipe I know.
     White chocolate may be drizzled over the milk chocolate for a fancier look.
     They are perfect for parties, Valentine's Day, and weddings.
     Decorate with frosting bow ties, bells, butterflies, hearts, roses, etc.
