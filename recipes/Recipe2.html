        <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
            These chocolate-covered strawberries are made with the simplest recipe I know.
            White chocolate may be drizzled over the milk chocolate for a fancier look.
            They are perfect for parties, Valentine's Day, and weddings.
            Decorate with frosting bow ties, bells, butterflies, hearts, roses, etc.
